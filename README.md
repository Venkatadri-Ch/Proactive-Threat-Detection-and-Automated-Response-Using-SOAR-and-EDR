# Proactive-Threat-Detection-and-Automated-Response-Using-SOAR-and-EDR
Integrating LimaCharlie,Tines and Slack for Next-Generation Security Operations   

## Objective

To design and implement an automated threat detection and response system by integrating Tines as the SOAR platform and Lima Charlie as the EDR solution. The system aims to promptly identify suspicious activities (such as the execution of password recovery tools), generate alerts, and automate notifications through Slack and Email. Additionally, it facilitates rapid incident response by enabling user-driven decisions to isolate affected machines, thereby minimizing potential security threats and improving overall incident handling efficiency.

### Skills Learned 

- Security Automation – Built automated detection and response workflows using Tines, LimaCharlie, slack and email.

- SOAR Integration – Configured Tines for alert handling, notifications, and user-driven actions.

- EDR Usage – Monitored endpoints with LimaCharlie to detect suspicious activity.

- Alerting & Notifications – Set up automated Slack and Email alerts for security incidents.

- Incident Response – Enabled user decisions for actions like isolating compromised machines.

- API Integration – Connected SOAR, EDR, and messaging tools through API-based workflows.

- Threat Detection – Identified risky behaviors  on endpoints.
