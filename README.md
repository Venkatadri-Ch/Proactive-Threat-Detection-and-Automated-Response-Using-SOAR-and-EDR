# Proactive-Threat-Detection-and-Automated-Response-Using-SOAR-and-EDR
Integrating LimaCharlie,Tines and Slack for Next-Generation Security Operations   

## Objective

To design and implement an automated threat detection and response system by integrating Tines as the SOAR platform and Lima Charlie as the EDR solution. The system aims to promptly identify suspicious activities (such as the execution of password recovery tools), generate alerts, and automate notifications through Slack and Email. Additionally, it facilitates rapid incident response by enabling user-driven decisions to isolate affected machines, thereby minimizing potential security threats and improving overall incident handling efficiency.

### Skills Learned 

- Built automated security workflows using Tines (SOAR).

- Set up alerting and notification systems in Tines.

- Used Lima Charlie to monitor and detect suspicious endpoint activities.

- Created workflows for real-time incident response and machine isolation.

- Developed processes to quickly contain threats and reduce response time.

- Integrated Tines, Lima Charlie, Slack, and Email into one automated solution.

- Configured automated alerts via Slack and Email for better communication.

- Learned proactive threat detection and response methods.
